Steps to use the canny detector
1. Blur the image using the guassian Blur
2. choose the two thresholds to be use
3. apply the canny algorithm


#=============================>
Steps to approach the problem
1. Load the video and convert it to frames to be saved in a certain location
2. Take an image from the frames
3. Apply guassian blur to the image
4. apply the canny detector to it
5. apply the hough transforms to it to find the lines
